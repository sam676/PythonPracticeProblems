You're building a social networking platform and save your user's phone
numbers as integers. However, when you display the phone number on their
profile, it isn't formatted and looks pretty ugly. It's time to write a
function that takes in 10 integers and returns the phone number as a formatted
string. The string would look something like this: (123) 456-7890
