"""
Do you remember learning your multiplication tables?
For some, it was really easy. For others, they still have to
perform multiplication using odd tricks. Today, we're all lucky,
because we can practice by writing code that will print all the
multiplication tables from 1 to X. The format could look something
like this: '1 x 1 = 1' . Have fun taking a trip down memory lane!
