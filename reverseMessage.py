Today's question
You are a newbie detective investigating a murder scene in the boardroom
at the Macrosoft Corp. While searching for clues, you discover a red notebook.
Inside of the notebook are long journal entries with inverted messages.
At that moment, you remembered from your profiler fatherâ€™s advice that
you could stand in front of the mirror to see the messages.
However, you have not slept for 3 days in a row...and haven't showered either.
Because you really don't want to see your face, you decide that you would
rather build an app that can take in a message string and return
the reversed message for you. Now you just need to come up with a
function to build your app - and don't take the shortcut using the "reverse"
method ;)Please reverse this message found in the spooky journal:
